            <h1>The Big Dipper</h1>
            <p>
              * When we first interacted with the artwork, we really liked its idea of stars and constellations.
          </p>
          <p>
            * So we chose a specific constellation to present the artwork, which is the Big Dipper.
          </p>
          <p>
            * We tried to mimic the actual "starry night" on our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            * We like the way that each star opens a different email message, so our stars in the Big Dipper direct to different pages of our presentation.
